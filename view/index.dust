			This is the <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/sidekick/blob/master/PROPOSAL.md">proposal for a new project</a> based around Pa11y.{~s}
			The project is code-named "Sidekick". Well done for getting it up-and-running locally!
		</p>
		<p>
			We maintain an <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/sidekick/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md">Architecture Guide</a> which outlines how the application works, and how everything fits together.{~s}
			It's strongly recommended that you read through it if you want to contribute.{~s}
			We're currently in the architecture stage of development so this application has few features â€“ it's purely a demo of <i>how</i> we want to build things.
