		This is the proposal for a new project based around Pa11y. The project is code-named{~s}
		"Sidekick". Well done for getting it up-and-running locally!
	</p>
	<p>
		We maintain an Architecture Guide (see below) which outlines how the application works,{~s}
		and how everything fits together. It's strongly recommended that you read through it if{~s}
		you want to contribute. We're currently in the architecture stage of development so this{~s}
		application has no features â€“ it's purely a demo how <i>how</i> we want to build things.{~s}
